    "lyrics": "[00:04.58] Yeah, how could you be so careless? I sweat this, I swear\n[00:11.15] I think I'm losing my voice, I took no time to take care\n[00:17.14] I smashed my phone, but honestly, I feel relieved\n[00:21.40] You can't reach me, now I can exhale on my own\n[00:28.29] What were you thinking, that night was a dream?\n[00:33.62] At the top of your lungs, I've heard you scream in your sleep\n[00:39.19] And I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation, so\n[00:46.15] How much is enough gonna take? Yeah\n[00:51.12] I've got a number for you\n[00:54.71] I call it breaking, yeah\n[00:57.52] I've got a lover, baby\n[01:00.19] Don't need what you're giving me, more than what you think\n[01:04.77] Oh, love ain't love, If It ain't rough, but\n[01:09.45] You're screaming\n[01:12.74] I've said it all\n[01:16.71] I thought maybe you'd believe me, 'cause I don't\n[01:22.55] These days it's a clich√©, I know\n[01:27.40] I have no words, no words\n[01:35.81] \n[02:03.08] And if I could forget you, you know I would leave\n[02:09.06] I can't help myself from feeling all this is wasted on me\n[02:16.38] And I love the rain (love!), but I can't live in a storm\n[02:25.24] I got more to go\n[02:29.58] Still learning to grow\n[02:36.12] What were you thinking, that night was a dream?\n[02:41.25] At the top of your lungs, I hear you screaming, no sleep\n[02:46.86] And I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation, so\n[02:53.81] How much is enough gonna take? Yeah\n[02:59.85] I got a lifetime to wait\n[03:05.15] Seconds can't bury me\n[03:09.42] ",
